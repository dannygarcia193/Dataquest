# **Survey_Analysis**
## **Introduction**

The purpose of this analyses is to discover potential patterns regarding employee's who have terminated their employment at The Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) insititute in Queensland, Austrlia. The insights will be used as a basis for further analyses as well as for potential recommendations for improvements in reducing employee turnover for the two institutes. For this analyses, the employee exist survey's released by the insititutes, which can be found here ([TAFE](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey))and here ([DETE](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey)) were used.

The analyses as hypothetically requested by the institutes was mainly focused on dissatisfaction as a factor of employee turnover. As such, this project aimed at answering the following questions:

- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction?
- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction?
- How does dissatisfaction compare between the two institutions?
- How does dissatisfaction differs amongt institute and gender subgroups?

## **Findings**
> **The initial analyses revealed that as a whole, older employees (51+) and those with the most experience (7+ years at the company) report more dissatisfaction than younger and more inexperienced employees for both institutes. In addition, DATE employees on a whole, reported more dissatisfaction (50%) relative to TAFE employees (31%). Further analysis showed experienced male Date employees to overwhelmingly report being dissatisfied with the company (67 to 70%)--the highest of all subgroups(as defined by institute and gender). For TAFE, female established employees (7-11 years of institute service) report the highest percentage of dissatisfaction (46%) amongst the subgroups.**
> **Further analysis should dive deeper into the reasons for high dissatisfaction levels for older and experience employees, in particular for male DETE employee and female TAFE employees. Lastly, the DETE institute should also investigate into why their reported overall level of dissatisfaction is much higher when compared to the TAFE institute.**
